# Introducing Whisper 

Github Repo: https://github.com/adrian3/whisper

Whisper generates a website from markdown files stored in Dropbox. 

If you love Markdown (and who doesn't?) and hate the complexity of everything else about managing a website, Whisper is for you. Once you have Whisper set up, any changes you make to your markdown files will get converted to HTML and pushed to your website. 

- No code editors
- No databases
- No CMS
- No command lines
- No uploading
- No templating languages
- No messing with HTML (unless you want to)

With Whisper you get the speed of a static files without the complexity of other flat file CMS's. If this sounds like what you have been looking for, Whisper might be for you.
