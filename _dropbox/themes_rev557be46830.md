# Themes

My plan is to provide a skeleton theme for the following popular responsive frameworks:

- Foundation
- Bootstrap
- MDL
- Tachyons

In the meantime, Steam comes with a minimal theme that you can build on. It uses a lightly modified version of the Air theme from [MarkdownCSS](http://markdowncss.github.io).
