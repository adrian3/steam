# About Steam

Steam generates a website from markdown files stored in Dropbox. 

If you love Markdown (and who doesn't?) and hate the complexity of everything else about managing a website, Steam is for you. Once you have Steam set up, any changes you make to your markdown files will get converted to HTML and pushed to your website. 

- No code editors
- No databases
- No CMS
- No command lines
- No uploading
- No templating languages
- No messing with HTML (unless you want to)

With Steam you get the speed of a static files without the complexity of other flat file CMS's. If this sounds like what you have been looking for, Steam might be for you.

## Road Map
- Add themes
- Minification
- Add support for blog comments (disqus?)
- Make Steam a Jekyll substitute
- Add flexibility with how the date format of blog posts are handled
- Automated Dropbox authentication to simplify setup
- Is there any interest in a hosted version of Steam where you could create websites without a hosting plan?
